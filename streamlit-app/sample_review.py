    "Positive Review 😊": (
        "This movie genuinely surprised me in the best possible way. "
        "While the opening scenes were a bit slow, the story gradually "
        "builds into something emotionally engaging. The performances "
        "are excellent, the cinematography is beautiful, and the ending "
        "is meaningful and satisfying. I would definitely recommend this film."
    ),

    "Negative Review 😞": (
        "I honestly don't understand the praise for this movie. The pacing "
        "is painfully slow, the characters are shallow, and the dialogue "
        "feels forced. Even the ending was predictable and unsatisfying. "
        "Overall, it was boring and a complete waste of time."
    ),

    "Mixed Review 🤔": (
        "The movie has a strong concept and some good performances, but the "
        "execution is inconsistent. While certain scenes are engaging, "
        "others drag on unnecessarily. It's not terrible, but it could have "
        "been much better."
    ),
    "Sarcastic Review 😏- Negative":(
        "Wow, what an amazing experience. I absolutely loved sitting through two and a half"
        "hours of slow pacing, awkward dialogue, and completely forgettable characters. Every"
        "scene felt longer than the last, which really gave me plenty of time to reflect on my life"
        "choices. The ending was especially impressive in how predictably disappointing it was."
        "If you enjoy being bored in the most artistic way possible, this movie is definitely for you."

    "Sarcastic Review 🥱😒- Very Negative":(
        "This movie deserves an award for making absolutely nothing happen for such a long"
        "time. The performances were so emotionally flat that I almost mistook them for"
        "background furniture. The plot twists were thrilling in the same way watching paint dry"
        "is thrilling. Truly a masterpiece if the goal was to waste everyone's time. I can't wait to"
        "never watch this again."
    ),
    "Sarcastic Review 😁- Positive (Reverse Sarcasm)":(
        "I went into this movie expecting something terrible, and I'm genuinely shocked at how"
        "wrong I was. The story was engaging, the characters were well written, and the"
        "emotional moments actually worked. It's refreshing to see a film that doesn't rely on"
        "cheap tricks. If this is sarcasm, then it's the kind that accidentally turns into a"
        "compliment, because the movie was actually very good."
    ),
    "Sarcastic / Mixed 😵‍💫🙃":(
        "The movie is clearly trying very hard to be deep and meaningful, and I truly admire the"
        "effort. Whether it succeeds is another question. Some scenes are genuinely good, while"
        "others feel like they exist just to fill time. It's the kind of film that makes you say"
        "“interesting choice” more than once. Not terrible, not great - just memorable in a very specific way."
